* Willingly take on tasks outside your job description to support the team
* Enjoy pair programming and collaborative work
* Are eager to learn more about machine learning research
* Are enthusiastic to work at an organization that functions as a single, cohesive team pursuing large\\-scale AI research projects
* Are working to align state of the art models with human values and preferences, understand and interpret deep neural networks, or develop new models to support these areas of research
* View research and engineering as two sides of the same coin, and seek to understand all aspects of our research program as well as possible, to maximize the impact of your insights
* Have ambitious goals for AI safety and general progress in the next few years, and you’re working to create the best outcomes over the long\\-term.


**Sample Projects**
* Optimizing the throughput of novel attention mechanisms

 At Anthropic, we are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace. We strongly encourage applications from candidates of all backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups in tech.
   

  

 If you're excited about pushing the boundaries of AI while prioritizing safety and ethics, we want to hear from you!
   

  

**Annual Salary**
 The expected salary range for this position is:
   

  

 $315,000 — $340,000 USD
   

  

****Logistics****
**Education requirements:** 
 We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.
   

  

**Location\\-based hybrid policy:** 
 Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.
   

  

**Visa sponsorship:** 
 We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.
   

  

**We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.** 
 Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.
   

  

****How we're different****
 We believe that the highest\\-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large\\-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long\\-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest\\-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.
   

  

 The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT\\-3, Circuit\\-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI \\& Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
   

  

****Come work with us!****
 Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.","Research Services","https://www.linkedin.com/company/anthropicresearch","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQFMhKgeR7EYAg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1719256989269/anthropicresearch_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=wN6y3zcI_-vsVBJOlfO3ChnXP7tCkDhgXODydqtMIAE","","","","",""
