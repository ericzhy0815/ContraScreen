After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.  

  

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.  

  

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise\\-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn't work together.



So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we've embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.



Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise\\-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us.

This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.  

  

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.  

  

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise\\-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn't work together.



So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we've embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.



Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise\\-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We're building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.


**The Role**



Businesses thrive on relationships, and the Customer Engagement team is at the heart of enabling Sellers to build long\\-lasting connections with their customers.

Waymo is an autonomous driving technology company with the mission to be the most trusted driver. Since its start as the Google Self\\-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has focused on building the Waymo Driver—The World's Most Experienced Driver™—to improve access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. The Waymo Driver powers Waymo One, a fully autonomous ride\\-hailing service, and can also be applied to a range of vehicle platforms and product use cases. The Waymo Driver has provided over one million rider\\-only trips, enabled by its experience autonomously driving tens of millions of miles on public roads and tens of billions in simulation across 13\\+ U.S. states.


Rigorous performance evaluation of the Waymo Driver is a critical part of scaling our ride hailing service and achieving Waymo’s audacious goals. Waymo data scientists work hand\\-in\\-hand with engineering teams at each stage of the software development cycle, employing statistical models and developing metrics and measurement frameworks to ensure that the Waymo Driver meets our strict standards for safety, compliance, and driving and service quality. Autonomous driving presents a new paradigm in data science: in addition to leveraging data collected on\\-road, we generate our own data using state\\-of\\-the\\-art simulation technology—resulting in denser signals and challenging new problems in estimation and experimental design.



In this hybrid role you will report to a Data Science Manager.


**You will:**


* Develop evaluation frameworks for autonomous vehicle performance, for large\\-scale ML models, and for the quality of simulation.
* Develop new metrics, interpret trends, and investigate anomalies in data from simulation and on\\-road driving.
* Develop novel statistical methods to handle unique aspects of AV data; e.g. rate estimation with rare events, combining real and synthetic data, etc.
* Frame and solve ambiguous problems, derive data\\-driven conclusions, and communicate findings to senior stakeholders.
* Collaborate with Product and Engineering partners developing the Waymo Driver and Waymo’s simulation software; facilitate deployment readiness decisions for both products.


**You have:**


* Degree in a quantitative field (e.g. Statistics, Mathematics, Physics)
* 3\\+ years of industry experience solving data science problems or a PhD in a quantitative field
* Expertise using advanced statistical methods in an applied setting; familiarity with ML systems/models
* Demonstrated knowledge of Python/SQL/R data analysis libraries and packages


**We prefer:**


* PhD in a quantitative field
* Experience solving problems related to Autonomous Driving or Ride Hailing
* Experience in adjacent relevant areas like Advanced Machine Learning (Deep Learning and Diffusion models), Traffic Modeling, Safety Evaluation or Prediction

Role Number:**200590796**  

  

Apple Silicon Engineering is seeking Hardware\\-minded Software engineers to build innovative tools to design the next generation of Apple’s world\\-leading systems\\-on\\-chip (SOCs) Apple’s multi\\-billion\\-transistor Ax SOCs are the brain of every iPhone and iPad. The Analog Mixed\\-Signal (AMS) circuits connect them to the physical world via complex IPs such as SERDES for data communication, PLLs for clock generation, and sensors for measuring physical quantities. Modeling Software Engineers bring a unique and versatile combination of software and hardware expertise. On their way from the designer's mind to becoming a piece of silicon, circuits take form in software. You will develop those software\\-representations of future hardware, and then make them real. This includes both the circuits themselves, and the underlying tools to enable hundreds more designers. We use modern software design methodology and apply it to AMS Hardware design. If you've written software in modern, designer\\-centric languages then you understand how powerful and freeing it can be. And If you've designed circuits, you know how hard it can be. Think of the IC\\-design tool\\-stack by analogy: RTL is C code, Schematics and gates are assembly, and Layout is machine language. Most IC design happens at one of those three layers, and most modern software design happens at a higher, more productive level. Tools handle the boring stuff and free designers to express their ideas. This is an opportunity to build that layer for IC hardware, and then use it to make the world's best mobile silicon. Core responsibilities: Architect, develop and test software to capture the behavior and performance of AMS circuits. SOME INDICATORS THAT YOU'D LOVE THIS JOB: \\- You wish that designing circuits felt more like writing Python code \\- Passion for building software to represent complex physical systems \\- Avid usage of \\- or contributions to \\- open\\-source scientific computing software \\- especially packages for hardware design, signal processing, and/or data analysis \\- An open mind about trying new things. Especially new tools  

  

**Description**  

  

Work on a simulation platform connecting multiple simulators to design analog mixed\\-signal IPs Design and development of Scientific Software package/framework Develop custom hardware description libraries, frameworks, and/or languages Design digital, analog, and mixed\\-signal simulation software  

  

**Minimum Qualifications**  

* Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering preferred.

  

**Preferred Qualifications**  

* Expert level in Python and/or C\\+\\+
* Expert in Object\\-oriented Software (OOP)
* Knowledge of Database frontend and backend
* Familiarity with simulation tools for analog, digital, and/ or mixed\\-signal circuits
* Familiarity with popular digital design HDLs (Verilog and/or VHDL)
* Understanding of specs and requirements for AMS circuits is a plus

**About The Role**
------------------


Join the HRIS Company Team at Rippling, where you'll play a crucial role in transforming the onboarding and purchasing experience for thousands of businesses. As a fast\\-growing SaaS company, Rippling is dedicated to addressing key challenges in our current processes, such as the complex and manual nature of new company onboarding, the lack of flexibility in app purchasing, and the absence of trial opportunities for potential customers.

As an engineer on this dynamic team, you'll tackle these challenges head\\-on by developing self\\-serve SaaS product trial and sign\\-up flows, revamping onboarding workflows to reduce manual steps, and building near\\-real\\-time data sync systems with third\\-party HCM systems. Join us to make a significant impact and drive innovation at Rippling.

**What You'll Do**

* Develop and improve user\\-facing features, working across the stack to make them shine
* Collaborate closely with PMs, designers, and other experts to figure out the best way to bring features to life.
* Create seamless, impactful experiences for both our UI and API layers.
* Move quickly and confidently, making smart decisions to fill in the gaps where product details aren’t fully defined—always learning from user feedback.
* Play an active role in building a culture of excellence within our product and engineering teams.

**What You'll Need**
--------------------

* Extensive Experience: Over 7 years in product engineering with expertise in Python, Django, or related technologies.
* Scalability Insight: Proven track record with systems operating at significant technical and organizational scales.
* Product Intuition: Strong sense of design and user experience, with the ability to quickly identify and implement enhancements.
* Frontend Expertise: Strong command of frontend development patterns and frameworks, such as MVC and MVVM.
* UI Development: Deep experience building user interfaces with React or similar frameworks.
* Project Leadership: Successful history of shipping complex projects from concept to completion.

The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter\\-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.



We adopt a finance\\-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is *truly* saying.



We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co\\-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee \\& Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few.

  

Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Mathematical Scientist. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI\\-Quants.

  

This role is an ***in\\-house mathematician*** role. As such, you'll be involved in formulating fundamental questions arising as part of the investment process as mathematical problems consistent with our research philosophy, and you'll be responsible for solving those mathematical problems. This role is central to our research efforts, and your output is expected to have a critical impact on our bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term.

  

The ideal candidate typically loves (and is capable of) testing and proving complex theorems and conjectures of her/his own, but prefers industry over academia as she/he is eager and impatient to see the impact of her/his work in real\\-life. She/he never shies away from finding closed\\-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype\\-quality Python code to test found mathematical results.

  

Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.

  

We strongly encourage applicants to read our blog posts (http://bit.ly/2Jf97aV) prior to applying, in order to get acquainted with our research philosophy and some of our works.

 **Requirements:**


* Ph.D. / Post Doc in Maths from a top university or research group, with an emphasis on stochastic analysis, optimization, and/or functional analysis.
* Excellent graduate\\-level understanding of probability theory, stochastic analysis, functional analysis and optimization, as evidenced for instance by a French DEA in maths, or the Cambridge Part III, prior to your PhD in Maths.
* Strong intuition to guide the design of reasonable conjectures from the geometry of the problem and background knowledge prior to attempting any proof.
* No finance or machine learning experience is required.","","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Pit.ai-Technologies-Inc.","","","","","",""

-----------------------

**What you'll do...**
---------------------


Cortex Team is Walmart’s core A.I. conversational platform, powering the vision of delivering the world’s best personal assistants to Walmart’s customers, accessible via natural voice commands, text messages, rich UI interactions, and a mix of all of the above via multi\\-modal experiences.


We believe *conversations* are a natural and powerful user interface for interacting with technology and enable a richer customer experiences – both online and in\\-store. We are building and designing the next generation of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) services that other teams can easily integrate and leverage, and build rich experiences: from pure voice and text shopping assistants (Siri, Sparky), to customer care channels, to mobile apps with rich, intertwined, multi\\-modal interaction modes (Me@Walmart).


Interested in diving in?


We need solid engineers with the talent and expertise required to design, build, improve and evolve our capabilities in at least some of the following areas:

* Service oriented architecture in charge of exposing our NLU capabilities at scale, and enabling increasingly sophisticated model orchestration.
	+ Since the service takes in traffic for a large set of Walmart customers (that is 80% of American households!), you will get to solve non trivial challenges in terms of service scalability and availability.
	+ You will design and build the primitives to efficiently orchestrate model\\-serving microservices, taking into account their dependencies, and improving the *combined* latency and robustness of such microservices (e.g. fan out in parallel to N services for a single request, and reply with whichever gives the fastest answer).
	+ You will also bake\\-in functionality which can drive improved machine learning modeling and experimental design, such as A/B testing.
* Model serving and operations
	+ There is a constant tension between model improvements (more computations) and model serving latency. So, we are always in a quest of crunching more numbers, while preserving our SLAs, and controlling the operational costs.
	+ You will guide our efforts to always find the best tradeoffs in terms of architecture, tooling (Tensorflow serving? / ONNYX? / Triton?) and infrastructure (CPU? / GPU?, GCP? / Azure?) for model serving – based on the latest model developments and product requirements.
	+ In particular, you will drive principled and scientific load\\-testing efforts, to clearly identify the tradeoffs at hands, and tune/optimize the model\\-serving stack.
	+ If interested, you will also get some opportunity to work on prompt engineering and agentic systems.
* Tooling, infrastructure and pipelines for reproducible workflow and models, enabling rapid innovation across the entire product lifecycle.
	+ You will author and maintain pipelines that safely build and deploy models to production via continuous deployment.
	+ You will achieve scalable and efficient resource management capabilities (cloud infrastructure).
	+ You will provide robust and built\\-in diagnostics for quality control throughout.
	+ You will integrate – or build – labeling tools which can seamlessly integrate at the heart of our conversation data store (GCP, BigQuery) and intertwine multiple labeling sources of various confidence levels.


Come at the right time, and you will have an enormous opportunity to make a massive impact on the design, architecture, and implementation of an innovative, mission critical product, used every day, by people you know, and which customers love.


As part of the emerging tech group, you will also have the additional opportunity of building demos, proof of concepts, creating white papers, writing blogs, etc.

**Note that this is not a fully remote job, you are required to come to the office (currently at least 2 days a week).**


Minimum Qualifications

* 4 years’ experience in software engineering or related area.
* Solid data skills, sound computer\\-science fundamentals, and strong programming experience.
* Deep hands\\-on technical expertise in full\\-stack development.
* Programming experience with at least one modern language with an efficient runtime, such as Scala, Java, C\\+\\+, or C\\#.
* Experience with at least one relational database technology such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or MS SQL.
* Some level of fluency in Python (lingua\\-franca of our data\\-scientists).
* Understanding of the challenge of distributed data\\-processing at scale.
* Deal well with ambiguous/undefined problems; ability to think abstractly.
* Ability to take a project from scoping requirements through actual launch.
* A continuous drive to explore, improve, enhance, automate, and optimize systems and tools.
* Capacity to apply scientific analysis and mathematical modeling techniques to predict, measure and evaluate the consequences of designs and the ongoing success of our platform.
* Excellent oral and written communication skills.
* Bachelor’s degree or certification in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, or any other related field.


Preferred Qualifications

* Large scale distributed systems experience, including scalability and fault tolerance.
* Experience taking a leading role in building complex data\\-driven software systems successfully delivered to customers
* Relentless focus on scalability, latency, performance robustness, and cost trade\\-offs – especially those present in highly virtualized, elastic, cloud\\-based environments.
* Exposure to cloud infrastructure, such as Open Stack, Azure, GCP, or AWS as well as infrastructure management tech (Docker, Kubernetes)
* Experience building/operating highly available systems of data extraction, ingestion, and massively parallel processing for large data sets. In particular experience in building large scale data pipelines using big data technologies (e.g. Spark / Kafka / Cassandra / Hadoop / Hive / BigQuery / Presto / Airflow).
* Hands\\-on expertise in many disparate technologies, typically ranging from front\\-end user interfaces through to back\\-end systems and all points in between.
* Familiarity with Machine Learning concepts \\& processes
* Masters or PhD in Computer Science, Physics, Engineering, Math, or equivalent.

**About The Team**
 Our research focuses on the next frontier: developing self\\-improving machine learning systems that leverage AI to optimize and enhance AI itself. Our core thesis is that by enabling AI systems to autonomously refine their own architecture, learning algorithms, and data utilization, we can achieve orders of magnitude improvement over current methodologies.
   

  

 An AI system is built upon three fundamental layers: the infraestructure layer, encompassing both hardware and software infrastructure; the modeling layer, which defines model architectures and training methodologies; and the data layer, where data selection and supervision strategies come into play. Traditionally, each of these layers relies heavily on human intervention, demanding specialized expertise and manual tuning. Yet, self\\-improving ML systems will be able to optimize these elements with unparalleled precision and efficiency, surpassing the capabilities of human experts.
   

  

 By pioneering self\\-improving ML, we aim to make AI not just a powerful tool for automatically solving today’s challenges but a dynamic entity that can evolve independently to tackle the complex problems of tomorrow. This evolution goes beyond technological advancement; we believe it can drive meaningful change. Our research is contributing to more sustainable use of resources, reduce energy consumption, and ultimately enable AI to address environmental and societal challenges more effectively. Through this work, we aspire to harness AI’s potential to make the world not only smarter but also more sustainable for future generations.

 Custom SoCs (System on Chips) are the brains behind AWS’s Machine Learning servers. Our team builds C\\+\\+ \\& SystemC functional models of these custom\\-designed accelerator SoCs for use by AWS internal teams. We’re looking for a Senior SoC Modeling Engineer to join the team and deliver new functional models, infrastructure, and tooling for our customers.
   

  

 As part of the ML accelerator modeling team, you will:
   

  

* Develop and own SoC functional models end\\-to\\-end, including model architecture, integration with other model or infrastructure components, testing, and debug
* Work closely with architecture, RTL design, design verification, emulation, and software teams to build, debug, and deploy your models
* Innovate on the tooling you provide to customers, making it easier for them to use our SoC models
* Drive model and modeling infrastructure performance improvements to help our models scale
* Develop software which can be maintained, improved upon, documented, tested, and reused


 Annapurna Labs, our organization within AWS, designs and deploys some of the largest custom silicon in the world, with many subsystems that must all be modeled and tested with high quality. Our SoC model is a critical piece of software used in both our SoC development process and by our partner software teams. You’ll collaborate with many internal customers who depend on your models to be effective themselves, and you'll work closely with these teams to push the boundaries of how we're using modeling to build successful products.
   

  

**You Will Thrive In This Role If You**
* Are an expert in functional modeling for SoCs, ASICs, TPUs, GPUs, or CPUs
* Are comfortable modeling in C\\+\\+ or SystemC, and familiar with Python
* Enjoy learning new technologies, building software at scale, moving fast, and working closely with colleagues as part of a small team within a large organization
* Want to jump into an ML\\-aligned role, or get deeper into the details of ML at the hardware/system\\-level


 Although we are building machine learning chips, no machine learning background is needed for this role. This role spans modeling of the ML and management regions of our chips, and you’ll dip your toes into both. You’ll be able to ramp up on ML as part of this role, and any ML knowledge that’s required can be learned on\\-the\\-job.
   

  

 This role can be based in either Cupertino, CA or Austin, TX. The broader team is split between the two sites, with a slight preference for CA, due to colocation with more customer teams.
   

  

 We're changing an industry. We're searching for individuals who are ready for this challenge, who want to reach beyond what is possible today. Come join us and build the future of machine learning!

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn't work together.
   

  

 So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions \\- to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we've embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.
   

  

 Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes \\- large, enterprise\\-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We're building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

Reporting to the engineering manager on the team, you will be involved in the technical details of building available and reliable systems within the Android ecosystem, while also working with product teams to ensure Square to rapidly build new capabilities for our merchants and buyers all over the world.
   

  

**You Will** 
  




* Lead the architecture, design, and implementation of critical features within the Square Android Platform
* Represent the team in architectural discussions and stakeholder conversations, serving as a bridge between our team and the broader organization.

* Respond to customer feedback to improve our products.
* Focus on operational excellence to deliver fault\\-tolerant systems enabling our teams to move fast without negatively affecting our customers

"zr-amh_Vwabh5E9rGQvgABaUA","zip_recruiter","https://www.ziprecruiter.com/jobs//j?lvk=amh_Vwabh5E9rGQvgABaUA","","Design Engineer - Americas","Ashby","San Francisco, CA, USA","2025-02-12","fulltime","direct_data","yearly",170000.0,260000.0,"USD","","","","organic","","Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik, Ashby's Co\\-Founder and VP of Engineering. As someone who could design and build software, this position is close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate
 *in code* 
 . My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one —I couldn’t design
 *and* 
 build. At Ashby, you can.
 



 While every engineer can design
 *and* 
 build, you’ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in\\-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:
 


* Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.
* Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.
* Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate’s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.







 These projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered \\& extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.
 



 We have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I’ll share more once we meet.
 



**This is a staff\\-level role, so we require at least 5 years of experience as a full\\-time frontend engineer or evenly split between frontend and design for this role and significant contributions to (or leading) design systems.** 







 Engineering Culture
 
 Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my co\\-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high\\-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).
 






 Collaboration is Natural \\& Communication is Deliberate
 
 Our engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them here!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers spend less than 4 hours per week in meetings (I wrote about it here). 
 






 Increase Leverage, not Team Size
 
 We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:
 


* **Great developer tooling.** 
 Our CI/CD takes \\~10m, and we deploy at least 10x a day. Everyone on the team has contributed to developer experience 💪🏾
* **Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.** 
 At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).







 Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:
 

















 And a demo of one of these building blocks:
 










 Give Engineers Ownership \\& Autonomy
 
 We, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. Benji and I did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end\\-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end\\-to\\-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don’t get to practice as engineers, and, at Ashby, we provide mentorship to grow them and help from the team where you want it.
 






 Put Effort into Diversity 
 
 Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non\\-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups (including my daughter!).
 



 Today, 26% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.
 






 Interview Process
 
 At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions (no leetcode or whiteboard exercises). Our interview process is three rounds with some casual Zoom (or in\\-person) coffee in between to get to know each other: 
 


1. 30\\-minute introduction call to discuss Ashby and your past work (we demo Ashby!)
2. A technical screen (take home
 *or,* 
 for more experienced folks who want it, a 90\\-minute live session)
3. A virtual on\\-site of 3 hours and 45 minutes (can be split across two days)







 Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prepare you for interviews. You’ll meet other engineering leaders and 4 to 6 engineers (with 15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!
 






 Your First Two Months at Ashby
 
 We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment sets up with a single script, you push your first change on day one, and we spend the rest of the time building your confidence in our codebase and practices culminating in delivering a prominent, impactful feature. We’ll pair you with a peer who’ll guide you through your first tasks and be someone you rely on, from answering questions to pair programming.
 






 Technology Stack
 
 Our tech stack is TypeScript (frontend \\& backend), React, a mix of SASS modules and Stitches, Apollo GraphQL, Node.js, Postgres, and Redis. We're looking for folks with deep React, CSS, and HTML knowledge for this role.
 






 Benefits
 * Competitive salary and equity.
* *10\\-year exercise window for stock options* 
 . You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.
* Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one\\-on\\-one agenda until you start taking it 😅.
* *Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US.* 
 We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.
* Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!
* $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.
* If you’re in the US, top\\-notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us.



 Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.

It will have the power to transform the foundations of giant industries that rely on intensive computation. PsiQuantum is on a mission to build the world's first useful quantum computer, capable of delivering these transformative results.We know that means it will need 1 million qubits, error correction, a scalable architecture and a data center footprint.
 



 By harnessing the laws of quantum physics, quantum computers can provide exponential performance increases over today's most powerful supercomputers, offering the potential for extraordinary advances across a broad range of industries including climate, energy, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, finance, agriculture, transportation, materials design, and many more.
 



 PsiQuantum is uniquely positioned to deliver on the promise of quantum computing years earlier than our competitors. Our architecture is based on photonics which gives us the ability to produce our components using existing high\\-volume semiconductor manufacturing processes, the same processes that are today producing billions of chips for telecom and consumer electronics applications. Since photons don't feel heat, we can take advantage of existing cryogenic cooling systems, the kind that have been operating at facilities like the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC). And because photons are in fact light, they can move between subsystems at tremendous speed using standard fiber connectivity.
 



 Our team is building a utility scale quantum computer and the software tools needed to build fault tolerant quantum applications. We're a highly motivated and collaborative group focused on a singular goal \\- building the world's first useful quantum computer on the fastest path possible.
