Since 2014, our games\\-like Quiplash, Drawful, and Trivia Murder Party\\- have been featured on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, by Polygon, and in living rooms and finished basements across the world.


In 2020, we had over 200 million users. And we have hard evidence that one of those users was Academy Award\\-winner Charlize Theron.


You can learn everything you ever wanted to know about how our games work (spoiler: your phone is the controller!) and who we are and what we make at jackboxgames.com.

**What is the job?**


At Jackbox Games, we create unique, social games that bring people together. We’re looking for a Senior Full\\-Stack Software Engineer who thrives in ambiguity, enjoys tackling large\\-scale challenges, and can independently drive projects from idea to completion. If you have a history of taking loosely defined problems, structuring them into actionable solutions, and delivering results, we want to talk to you.


 This is not a game development role.

 **What you'll do:**

* Own and drive complex engineering challenges from concept to execution, breaking down open\\-ended problems into structured, deliverable projects.
* Design, develop, and maintain scalable, high\\-performance backend systems in Go (Golang) and frontend components in Vue.js, ensuring reliability, maintainability, and test coverage.

* Deep understanding of scalable, high\\-performance systems and real\\-time communication protocols.
* Strong debugging and problem\\-solving skills in complex environments.
* Strong communication skills: you can articulate technical challenges and solutions clearly.
* Experience with cloud platforms and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).
  

  

  

**OKAY, BUT WHAT ARE THE PERKS?!**

* Pay range: $105,393 \\- $157,464\\. Please note: individual compensation packages are based on factors unique to each candidate and position, including (but not limited to) skill set, experience, and qualifications.
* 401(k) with matching and various medical plans. We pay 100% of the cost of premiums for dental, vision, disability, and life insurance for our employees. We also cover a really nice chunk of the cost of premiums for spouse/partner/dependent medical, dental, and vision insurance.
* Flexible work schedule and environment. Currently, our employees are encouraged to work where they feel the safest and most productive. Our office in Lincoln Park in Chicago is open (and fully stocked with snacks) for folks who prefer to work in the office. We also offer remote work in the following states: California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.
* Flexible PTO. Take time off when you need to recharge, take a trip, or just catch up on life.
* Annual stipends for therapy, education, wellness, and home office equipment to encourage our employees’ lifelong learning pursuits and support mental and physical health.
* Creative work environment. We are lucky to work in a place that is full of talented and innovative folks. Most of the day, the place is pretty quiet (we’re a focused bunch), but this is punctuated with hilarious outbursts and general merriment.
* Free food either virtually or in the office. We stock our kitchen with snacks as well as offer doordash credits quite frequently.

### **Interested?**


Great, we look forward to reading your application. Please include:

* Your resume.
* A cover letter. You don't need to be a professional writer for this job (we have those) but communication is important so we weigh cover letters heavily.

On the fence? If you're interested in the job but worried you aren't qualified, we encourage you to err on the side of applying. We'd hate to miss out on great candidates just because they're worried they don't check every box on the job description.


We know it is a time commitment to prepare an application and we respect that effort by thoughtfully reviewing every complete application and responding one way or the other. But that kind of thoughtful review means that it sometimes takes us a while to get back to applicants, so please be patient with us and no phone calls.

**ABOUT THE TEAM**  

  

Our professionals in our Corporate Functions cover a diverse range of areas from finance and risk to human resources and marketing. Our corporate teams are an essential part of our company, ensuring that we’re setting our businesses, clients, customers and employees up for success.","","https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/W-EI_IE5224839.htm","https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/5224839/jpmorgan-chase-and-co-squareLogo-1724869012253.png","","","","",""

We're building Bitkey, a simple and safe self\\-custody bitcoin wallet that will put customers in control, as well as hardware and software that will help decentralize bitcoin mining and enable new and innovative use cases for bitcoin mining. We're developing these products in the open \\- you can read more about them at bitkey.build and mining.build. Within Proto, our Bitcoin Products team delivers the product and go\\-to\\-market strategy, software, firmware, and custom silicon needed to make Bitkey and our ambitious mining initiatives a reality. Come build the future of money with us!


**The Role**



Proto's vision is to contribute to the health of the bitcoin network by decentralizing both the supply of mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate. To realize this, we'll introduce competitive mining chips, rigs, and software products that offer new alternatives to mining operators of all sizes and which expand the scope of mining to include innovative applications (e.g. heat reuse, off\\-grid mining, home mining) beyond the current industrially\\-dominated market.



And we are well\\-positioned to deliver on this vision. Existing miners are not satisfied with our competitors — they're exhausted with unreliable hardware, difficulty securing supply, unfavorable payment terms, and nearly nonexistent support. All of these weaknesses are amongst our strengths: we've shipped tens of millions of reliable devices, are excellent operationally, can support a consistent supply of chips and rigs, and have strong customer support capability built up through multiple successful business lines. Additionally, we bring a clear customer focus and go\\-to\\-market capability that doesn't yet exist in mining — and mining operators recognize Block as a leader in the bitcoin space and are anxious to add an additional supplier, especially one based in the US.



We are seeking a skilled backend engineer for Proto's software suite. These two products aim to bring the best user experience in the world for miners to control their operation and connect with external services such as pools and miner management systems. Our approach is to give customers a significantly greater degree of control and diagnostic capability than what currently exists in the market. This role will be essential in making this experience a reality, not only focusing on how a miner may use our software to run their fleet, but ensuring we do it in a safe and secure manner.


**You Will**


* Design and implement APIs for bitcoin miner connectivity.
* Develop APIs to support real\\-time KPI monitoring, bulk deployment of settings, and parameter updates.
* Integrate miner fleet management systems with third\\-party tools for monitoring.
* Ensure secure and stable local connectivity for bitcoin mining hardware.
* Collaborate with hardware teams to validate mining system performance.
* Work closely with engineering and product teams to meet milestones, including upcoming demos and pilots, and our eventual launch later in the year.


**You Have**

  


* A minimum of 8 years professional experience building software
* Experience developing backend applications that communicate across the network.
* Experience with API design and implementation, particularly in real\\-time systems.
* Experience building relational databases for transactional and analytical workloads
* Expertise developing highly concurrent or asynchronous web application using NodeJS and Typescript or similar languages such as Go, Kotlin, Rust or Ruby
* Strong problem\\-solving skills and attention to detail.
* Ability to work in a fast\\-paced, milestone\\-driven environment.


**Bonus:**


* Familiarity with bitcoin mining hardware and protocols.
* Experience working with Electron or Tauri application frameworks.
* Experience implementing secure web authorization and authentication schemes.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

At Stripe, we are building a powerful suite of Data Products that enable all Stripes to understand, analyze, and take action based on data and metrics. As a Full Stack Engineer in our Data Products Workbench Team, you will play a crucial role in developing high leverage tooling and user interfaces for data visualization and analysis, all of which are critical to driving data literacy, empowering decision-making, and improving ML model performance across the organization. The team is part of the Data Platform Products organization and our long-term vision is to build a unified data product development experience at Stripe.

What you’ll do

Joining our Data Products Workbench Team means being part of an innovative and diverse team working on impactful projects that empower the entire Stripe organization. You will have the opportunity to shape the future of data-driven decision-making and help build world-class data products. If you have a passion for data, analytics, and delivering high-quality software, we would love to hear from you.

Responsibilities
• Build and launch new capabilities and products that bring significant value to users
• Work with a wide range of systems, processes and technologies to own and solve technical and product problems
• Design, develop, and maintain robust and scalable user interfaces and backend systems for our Data Products, ensuring high performance, accessibility, and responsiveness.

• Collaborate with stakeholders across the organization including dependency engineering teams, product, design, infrastructure, and operations
• Mentor engineers earlier in their technical careers to help them grow

Who you are

We’re looking for people with a strong background or interest in building successful products; you’re passionate about solving business problems and making impact, you are comfortable in dealing with lots of moving pieces; and you’re comfortable learning new technologies and systems.

Minimum Requirements
• Have a strong technical background, including 3+ years of experience working on full stack code bases and doing anything it takes to solve problems and delight users.
• Proficiency in front end technologies (HTML/CSS/Typescript/React/Redux/REST APIs).
• Experience with server-side programming using languages like Python, Node.js, or Go.
• Prefer simple solutions and designs over complex ones, and have a good intuition for what will last and scale.

Preferred Qualifications
• Experience of building front end technologies involving data-oriented products or analytics tools.

• Familiarity with relational and non-relational databases, and ability to design and optimize data schemas to support efficient querying and data processing, optimizing data pipelines, and ensuring seamless data flow across systems.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $209,800 - $314,800. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.","","","","","","","",""

You can learn everything you ever wanted to know about how our games work (spoiler: your phone is the controller!) and who we are and what we make at jackboxgames.com.

**What is the job?**


At Jackbox Games, we create unique, social games that bring people together. We’re looking for a Senior Full\\-Stack Software Engineer who thrives in ambiguity, enjoys tackling large\\-scale challenges, and can independently drive projects from idea to completion. If you have a history of taking loosely defined problems, structuring them into actionable solutions, and delivering results, we want to talk to you.


 This is not a game development role.

 **What you'll do:**

* Own and drive complex engineering challenges from concept to execution, breaking down open\\-ended problems into structured, deliverable projects.
* Design, develop, and maintain scalable, high\\-performance backend systems in Go (Golang) and frontend components in Vue.js, ensuring reliability, maintainability, and test coverage.
* Estimate work effectively and deliver solutions within reasonable timelines, while keeping stakeholders informed on progress, risks, and trade\\-offs.
* Collaborate with designers, artists, and engineers to create seamless player experiences and improve development workflows.
* Contribute to and maintain clear, useful technical documentation to support knowledge sharing and consistency across the team.
* Continuously improve performance, scalability, and engineering practices through mentorship, code reviews, and process enhancements.
  

  

**What we're looking for:**

* 5\\+ years of professional software engineering experience, ideally in full\\-stack or backend development.
* Strong proficiency in Go (Golang) and Vue.js (or a similar frontend framework).
* Proven experience taking large, ambiguous problems, structuring them into deliverable projects, and successfully shipping them.
* Deep understanding of scalable, high\\-performance systems and real\\-time communication protocols.
* Strong debugging and problem\\-solving skills in complex environments.
* Strong communication skills: you can articulate technical challenges and solutions clearly.
* Experience with cloud platforms and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).
  

  

  

**OKAY, BUT WHAT ARE THE PERKS?!**

* Pay range: $105,393 \\- $157,464\\. Please note: individual compensation packages are based on factors unique to each candidate and position, including (but not limited to) skill set, experience, and qualifications.
* 401(k) with matching and various medical plans. We pay 100% of the cost of premiums for dental, vision, disability, and life insurance for our employees. We also cover a really nice chunk of the cost of premiums for spouse/partner/dependent medical, dental, and vision insurance.
* Flexible work schedule and environment. Currently, our employees are encouraged to work where they feel the safest and most productive. Our office in Lincoln Park in Chicago is open (and fully stocked with snacks) for folks who prefer to work in the office. We also offer remote work in the following states: California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.
* Flexible PTO. Take time off when you need to recharge, take a trip, or just catch up on life.
* Annual stipends for therapy, education, wellness, and home office equipment to encourage our employees’ lifelong learning pursuits and support mental and physical health.
* Creative work environment. We are lucky to work in a place that is full of talented and innovative folks. Most of the day, the place is pretty quiet (we’re a focused bunch), but this is punctuated with hilarious outbursts and general merriment.
* Free food either virtually or in the office. We stock our kitchen with snacks as well as offer doordash credits quite frequently.

### **Interested?**


Great, we look forward to reading your application. Please include:

* Your resume.
* A cover letter. You don't need to be a professional writer for this job (we have those) but communication is important so we weigh cover letters heavily.

On the fence? If you're interested in the job but worried you aren't qualified, we encourage you to err on the side of applying. We'd hate to miss out on great candidates just because they're worried they don't check every box on the job description.


We know it is a time commitment to prepare an application and we respect that effort by thoughtfully reviewing every complete application and responding one way or the other. But that kind of thoughtful review means that it sometimes takes us a while to get back to applicants, so please be patient with us and no phone calls.

We're building Bitkey, a simple and safe self\\-custody bitcoin wallet that will put customers in control, as well as hardware and software that will help decentralize bitcoin mining and enable new and innovative use cases for bitcoin mining. We're developing these products in the open \\- you can read more about them at bitkey.build and mining.build. Within Proto, our Bitcoin Products team delivers the product and go\\-to\\-market strategy, software, firmware, and custom silicon needed to make Bitkey and our ambitious mining initiatives a reality. Come build the future of money with us!


**The Role**



Proto's vision is to contribute to the health of the bitcoin network by decentralizing both the supply of mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate. To realize this, we'll introduce competitive mining chips, rigs, and software products that offer new alternatives to mining operators of all sizes and which expand the scope of mining to include innovative applications (e.g. heat reuse, off\\-grid mining, home mining) beyond the current industrially\\-dominated market.



And we are well\\-positioned to deliver on this vision. Existing miners are not satisfied with our competitors — they're exhausted with unreliable hardware, difficulty securing supply, unfavorable payment terms, and nearly nonexistent support. All of these weaknesses are amongst our strengths: we've shipped tens of millions of reliable devices, are excellent operationally, can support a consistent supply of chips and rigs, and have strong customer support capability built up through multiple successful business lines. Additionally, we bring a clear customer focus and go\\-to\\-market capability that doesn't yet exist in mining — and mining operators recognize Block as a leader in the bitcoin space and are anxious to add an additional supplier, especially one based in the US.



We are seeking a skilled backend engineer for Proto's software suite. These two products aim to bring the best user experience in the world for miners to control their operation and connect with external services such as pools and miner management systems. Our approach is to give customers a significantly greater degree of control and diagnostic capability than what currently exists in the market. This role will be essential in making this experience a reality, not only focusing on how a miner may use our software to run their fleet, but ensuring we do it in a safe and secure manner.


**You Will**


* Design and implement APIs for bitcoin miner connectivity.
* Develop APIs to support real\\-time KPI monitoring, bulk deployment of settings, and parameter updates.
* Integrate miner fleet management systems with third\\-party tools for monitoring.
* Ensure secure and stable local connectivity for bitcoin mining hardware.
* Collaborate with hardware teams to validate mining system performance.
* Work closely with engineering and product teams to meet milestones, including upcoming demos and pilots, and our eventual launch later in the year.


**You Have**

  


* A minimum of 8 years professional experience building software
* Experience developing backend applications that communicate across the network.
* Experience with API design and implementation, particularly in real\\-time systems.
* Experience building relational databases for transactional and analytical workloads
* Expertise developing highly concurrent or asynchronous web application using NodeJS and Typescript or similar languages such as Go, Kotlin, Rust or Ruby
* Strong problem\\-solving skills and attention to detail.
* Ability to work in a fast\\-paced, milestone\\-driven environment.


**Bonus:**


* Familiarity with bitcoin mining hardware and protocols.
* Experience working with Electron or Tauri application frameworks.
* Experience implementing secure web authorization and authentication schemes.

As a Full Stack Engineer in our Data Products Workbench Team, you will play a crucial role in developing high leverage tooling and user interfaces for data visualization and analysis, all of which are critical to driving data literacy, empowering decision\\-making, and improving ML model performance across the organization. The team is part of the Data Platform Products organization and our long\\-term vision is to build a unified data product development experience at Stripe.
   

  

 What you’ll do
   

  

 Joining our Data Products Workbench Team means being part of an innovative and diverse team working on impactful projects that empower the entire Stripe organization. You will have the opportunity to shape the future of data\\-driven decision\\-making and help build world\\-class data products. If you have a passion for data, analytics, and delivering high\\-quality software, we would love to hear from you.

 Hybrid work at Stripe
   

  

 This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35\\+ miles or 56\\+ km from a Stripe office).
   

  

 Office\\-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in\\-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.
   

  

 A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on\\-sites, meet\\-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.
   

  

 Pay and benefits
   

  

 The annual US base salary range for this role is $209,800 \\- $314,800\\. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.
   

  

 Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.","Software Development, Financial Services, and Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/stripe","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQFqiwiSMcKk6A/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1724937022726/stripe_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=izBBwlcagZ_29QyD8kRFwxdV4_reYlATZI7uBtin61I","","","","",""

Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik, Ashby's Co\\-Founder and VP of Engineering. Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software. I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer, not just because the work was fun but because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand\\-ups, no t\\-shirt sizing, no planning meetings. It was an exhilarating experience to have straight out of college. I studied computer science to solve problems using software in a way that wasn’t possible before – not be a JIRA jockey. My first job allowed me to do just that, and I felt creative and fulfilled. When I moved to technology startups, I saw my role narrow (significantly as the company grew), and the enjoyment of building software went with it. It was disheartening because, in Visual Effects, I witnessed some of the most innovative ideas from experienced engineers who blended their technical skills with customer empathy and business context. Such ideas came from the engineers' in\\-depth knowledge of how software is built, allowing them to create new abstractions or implement technology in novel ways. It’s a level of creativity that is difficult for most product managers or designers to achieve. I still saw these ideas in technology startups, but as the team grew, these ideas often came to fruition through force of will and the engineer’s ability to push back against the company’s culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering became narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of ""Agile"" processes like sprint planning. I don’t want that to happen at Ashby. We’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces the innovative engineers, and frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end\\-to\\-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have: Designed and built automated candidate scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. Built a generalized filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user\\-facing features use it. Spec\\-ed, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features. What We’re Building Talent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up! Scheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last\\-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 Ashby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here (and are what we often replace!). We have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I’ll share more once we meet. Why You Should or Shouldn’t Apply Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for: You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team). You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and the intersection of the two is where you thrive. We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and much of the challenges we tackle require using your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems. You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn’t built quickly, we took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high\\-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency – we’ve built the equivalent of 3\\+ VC\\-backed startups with a very small team. You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it). You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here! You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time\\-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. Put another way, you shouldn’t apply if: You need company\\-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well\\-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges. You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high\\-leveled ICs. You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront. You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them. You want to mentor earlier career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects. Consequently, we need engineers with that experience, which requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 75% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited. A tech lead, staff, or principal engineer, to you, is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign\\-off. Engineering Culture Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my co\\-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high\\-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). Collaboration is Natural \\& Communication is Deliberate Our engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them here!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in \\<2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here). Increase Leverage, not Team Size We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in: Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes \\~10m, and we deploy at least 10x a day. Everyone on the team has contributed to developer experience 💪🏾 Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below). Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby: And a demo of one of these building blocks: Give Engineers Ownership \\& Agency We, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. Benji and I did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end\\-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end\\-to\\-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don’t get to practice as engineers, and, at Ashby, we provide mentorship to grow them and help from the team where you want it. Put Effort into Diversity Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non\\-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups. Today, 26% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more. Interview Process At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions (no leetcode or whiteboard exercises). Our interview process is three rounds: 30\\-minute introduction call A technical screen (take home or 75\\-minute in\\-person) A virtual on\\-site of 4 hours and 15 minutes (can be split across two days) Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback! Your First Two Months at Ashby We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment sets up with a single script, you push your first change on day one, and we spend the rest of the time building your confidence in our codebase and practices culminating in the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. We’ll pair you with a peer who’ll guide you through your first tasks and be someone you rely on, from answering questions to pair programming. Technology Stack I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend \\& backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis. Benefits Competitive salary and equity. 10\\-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable. Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one\\-on\\-one agenda until you start taking it 😅. Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise. Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive! $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval. If you’re in the US, top\\-notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us. Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply. Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities. Compensation Range: $160K \\- $260K","","","","","","","",""
