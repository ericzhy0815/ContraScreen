The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems.  

Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed.


Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you.  

### ***A day in the life:***


We're looking for a talented Data Scientist to support a program which leverages Natural Language Processing for analysis. As part of a dynamic team of Data Scientists, Developers and Cloud Architects, you will have the opportunity to develop many prototypes, test proof\\-of\\-concepts, and have the unique freedom to bring forth your own original ideas in direct support and alignment of specific customer needs and enterprise tradecraft. Development will be performed in an Open\\-Source environment where you will have direct access to the commercial cloud, tools, libraries and other necessary resources for the software development process.
### ***What you bring to the table:***


Now on to the fun of formal requirements \\- we have to apologize in advance for the corporate\\-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know. So do not worry about applying initially for every position you might be interested in. *All of our data scientists need the following skills:*

* Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python
* Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list.
* A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field.
* For entry\\-level data scientists, 0\\-3 years of experience on Data Science projects.
* For mid\\-level data scientists, 3\\-6 years of experience on Data Science projects.
* For senior\\-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on Data Science projects with at least 3 years of experience managing teams.
* A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance.

### ***The total package:***

Our total compensation package was strategically designed with our members in mind with the intention to: reward our members for their hard work and commitment to our customers' missions; allow members to share in Red Alpha's success as we continue to grow and expand our footprint; provide long\\-term career opportunities through stability and internal mobility; and provide the resources our members need to support themselves *and* their dependents in the form of a robust benefits package. Our total compensation package includes a competitive base salary and benefits such as health, life/disability, 401k, paid time off, professional development, and generous bonus programs. Please visit our **benefits** tab for additional information.
*Salary Range:** Disclosed pay ranges are a general guideline, and are not a guarantee of a final salary or compensation. Our approach in determining final salaries takes into consideration a number of factors such as education, certifications, total years of relevant professional experience, actual level of expertise, and the responsibilities of the role itself.
* Based on the outlined roles, responsibilities, and requirements, the projected pay range for this position is: $80,000 \\- $150,000
*Some of our additional perks and benefits include:** *Retire sooner* *than planned:* Get closer to retirement with up to 10% in 401k contributions, immediately vested.
* *Have a career AND a life:* Enjoy up to 5 weeks of leave (25 days of personal time off) and 11 paid floating holidays.

The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems.  

Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed.


Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you.  

### ***A day in the life:***


We're looking for a talented Data Scientist to support a program which leverages Natural Language Processing for analysis. As part of a dynamic team of Data Scientists, Developers and Cloud Architects, you will have the opportunity to develop many prototypes, test proof\\-of\\-concepts, and have the unique freedom to bring forth your own original ideas in direct support and alignment of specific customer needs and enterprise tradecraft. Development will be performed in an Open\\-Source environment where you will have direct access to the commercial cloud, tools, libraries and other necessary resources for the software development process.
### ***What you bring to the table:***


Now on to the fun of formal requirements \\- we have to apologize in advance for the corporate\\-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know. So do not worry about applying initially for every position you might be interested in. *All of our data scientists need the following skills:*

* Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python
* Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list.
* A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field.
* For entry\\-level data scientists, 0\\-3 years of experience on Data Science projects.
* For mid\\-level data scientists, 3\\-6 years of experience on Data Science projects.
* For senior\\-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on Data Science projects with at least 3 years of experience managing teams.
* A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance.

### ***The total package:***

Our total compensation package was strategically designed with our members in mind with the intention to: reward our members for their hard work and commitment to our customers' missions; allow members to share in Red Alpha's success as we continue to grow and expand our footprint; provide long\\-term career opportunities through stability and internal mobility; and provide the resources our members need to support themselves *and* their dependents in the form of a robust benefits package. Our total compensation package includes a competitive base salary and benefits such as health, life/disability, 401k, paid time off, professional development, and generous bonus programs. Please visit our **benefits** tab for additional information.
*Salary Range:** Disclosed pay ranges are a general guideline, and are not a guarantee of a final salary or compensation. Our approach in determining final salaries takes into consideration a number of factors such as education, certifications, total years of relevant professional experience, actual level of expertise, and the responsibilities of the role itself.
* Based on the outlined roles, responsibilities, and requirements, the projected pay range for this position is: $80,000 \\- $150,000

**Position Description** 




  





 At DDS, engineers are visible pillars on our cross\\-functional product teams. Whether they’re coding, hacking, or physically engineering hardware, DDS engineers are patient, collaborative leaders in all our projects. They are often responsible for compliance, security, function, and quality control of our work. DDS engineers suggest new ways technology could be utilized that may not have been previously considered, and they use modern tools and processes for software development. You’ll join an Engineering team composed of friendly, motivated individuals who will use innovative ways to get the job done and complete the mission.
 



  





 DDS Engineers might be specialists in some domain, like frontend, backend, hardware, data, or machine learning, or might be generalists who have some experience in a wide variety of technologies. We invite all types to apply.
 



  





**About Defense Digital Service** 




  





 DDS transforms how the Department of Defense (DoD) designs, builds, buys, and deploys technology to save lives and stay ahead of our adversaries. Our work touches on a wide range of issues \\-— from cybersecurity to climate; application building to data\\-wrangling. We tackle these complex challenges head\\-on by recruiting exceptional tech talent from industry and government to our talented team for a two\\-year term (with the option to renew for a second term).
 



  





 DDS is not like other workplaces. The work that you do here will directly contribute to our national security, improve the lives of those who serve, and make an impact that spans the globe. If you are thinking to yourself —
 *I’m not a DoD person* 
 , or
 *I’m not a government person* 
 – whatever that means to you, don’t be so convinced. The impact you can make here is truly phenomenal. If that excites you and you have the skills, you should apply. We are solving a diverse set of problems, and we need a diverse team to do it.
 



  





 Join the Defense Digital Service and build ground\\-breaking applications to protect the American people and support members of the military and their families.
 



  





 DDS works with partners from the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Government, and our allies to tackle some of the world’s toughest challenges. DDS engineers are called upon to fix a failing system, to recommend an iterative path forward through a seemingly difficult problem, or to develop a new capability.
 



  





 As an application engineer at DDS, whether you are fixing a mission critical system or fielding a new capability, you can see the real world impact of your work. Application engineers should be proficient in at least 2 widely used programming languages and familiar with the basics of networking and databases.
 



  





 Application engineers are members of the engineering Community of Practice (CoP) at the Defense Digital Service (DDS), which also includes data engineers, security engineers, and systems engineers. Engineers at DDS use modern tools and processes for software development.
 



  










**About the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office** 




  





 The Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) is a Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) responsible for the acceleration of the adoption of data, analytics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate decision advantage across the Department of Defense (DoD). The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), Defense Digital Services (DDS), Chief Data Office (CDO), and forward\\-leaning programs of record including Advana have officially joined together to form one organization‚ the CDAO! The CDAO is established to enable the Military Departments and Services, Joint Staff, Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and other DoD Components, to swiftly introduce new capabilities and effectively experiment with new operational concepts in support of DoD's warfighting missions.
 



  





 This role will close for submissions on March 14th, 2024 at 11:59:59pm.
 



  





**What you'll do here:** 




  




* You will architect, develop and deploy new features for various projects within the DDS portfolio

* Provide technical advice during the writing of contracts and/or manage contractor performance
* Ability to work in rapidly changing environments while collaborating with various teams and being a contributing team player

  The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems.
   


 Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed.   
 


 Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you.
   

  

**A day in the life:** 
  We're looking for a talented Data Scientist to support a program which leverages Natural Language Processing for analysis.  As part of a dynamic team of Data Scientists, Developers and Cloud Architects, you will have the opportunity to develop many prototypes, test proof\\-of\\-concepts, and have the unique freedom to bring forth your own original ideas in direct support and alignment of specific customer needs and enterprise tradecraft.  Development will be performed in an Open\\-Source environment where you will have direct access to the commercial cloud, tools, libraries and other necessary resources for the software development process.  
 

    
 

**What you bring to the table:** 
  Now on to the fun of formal requirements \\- we have to apologize in advance for the corporate\\-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know. So do not worry about applying initially for every position you might be interested in.
   


*All of our data scientists need the following skills:* 
    
 


* Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python
* Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list.
* A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field.
* For entry\\-level data scientists, 0\\-3 years of experience on Data Science projects.
* For mid\\-level data scientists, 3\\-6 years of experience on Data Science projects.
* For senior\\-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on Data Science projects with at least 3 years of experience managing teams.

**The Community – Baltimore, MD** 
  

 Baltimore is the second largest seaport in the Mid\\-Atlantic. Baltimore's Inner Harbor was once the second leading port of entry for immigrants to the United States and a major manufacturing center. After a decline in major manufacturing, industrialization and rail transportation, Baltimore shifted to a service\\-oriented economy, with the Johns Hopkins Hospital (founded 1889\\), and Johns Hopkins University (founded 1876\\), now the city's top two employers.
   

  

 With hundreds of identified districts, Baltimore has been dubbed ""a city of neighborhoods "". Famous residents have included the writers Edgar Allan Poe, Frederick Douglass and H.L. Mencken, jazz musician James ""Eubie "" Blake, singer Billie Holiday and baseball player Babe Ruth. In the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote The Star\\-Spangled Banner, later the American national anthem, in the city. Almost a quarter of the jobs in the Baltimore region are in science, technology, engineering and math, in part attributed to its extensive undergraduate and graduate schools.
