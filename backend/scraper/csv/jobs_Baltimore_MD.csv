Our Approach to Flexible Work

The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems.  

Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed.


Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you.

We're looking for a talented Data Scientist to support a program which leverages Natural Language Processing for analysis. As part of a dynamic team of Data Scientists, Developers and Cloud Architects, you will have the opportunity to develop many prototypes, test proof\\-of\\-concepts, and have the unique freedom to bring forth your own original ideas in direct support and alignment of specific customer needs and enterprise tradecraft. Development will be performed in an Open\\-Source environment where you will have direct access to the commercial cloud, tools, libraries and other necessary resources for the software development process.
### ***What you bring to the table:***

We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know.

* Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python
* Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list.
* A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field.
* For entry\\-level data scientists, 0\\-3 years of experience on Data Science projects.
* For mid\\-level data scientists, 3\\-6 years of experience on Data Science projects.
* For senior\\-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on Data Science projects with at least 3 years of experience managing teams.

"zr-vcHHVWbN_-5waAywF7wKEA","zip_recruiter","https://www.ziprecruiter.com/jobs//j?lvk=vcHHVWbN_-5waAywF7wKEA","","Junior Data Scientist (TS/SCI with Polygraph)","Red Alpha","Herndon, VA, USA","2025-02-12","","","","","","","","","","organic","","**A little about us:** 
  The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems.
   


 Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed.   
 


 Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you.
   

  

**A day in the life:** 
  We're looking for a talented Data Scientist to support a program which leverages Natural Language Processing for analysis.  As part of a dynamic team of Data Scientists, Developers and Cloud Architects, you will have the opportunity to develop many prototypes, test proof\\-of\\-concepts, and have the unique freedom to bring forth your own original ideas in direct support and alignment of specific customer needs and enterprise tradecraft.  Development will be performed in an Open\\-Source environment where you will have direct access to the commercial cloud, tools, libraries and other necessary resources for the software development process.  
 

    
 

**What you bring to the table:** 
  Now on to the fun of formal requirements \\- we have to apologize in advance for the corporate\\-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know. So do not worry about applying initially for every position you might be interested in.
   


*All of our data scientists need the following skills:* 
    
 


* Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python
* Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list.
* A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field.
* For entry\\-level data scientists, 0\\-3 years of experience on Data Science projects.
* For mid\\-level data scientists, 3\\-6 years of experience on Data Science projects.
* For senior\\-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on Data Science projects with at least 3 years of experience managing teams.
* A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance.


**The total package:** 


 Our total compensation package was strategically designed with our members in mind with the intention to: reward our members for their hard work and commitment to our customers' missions; allow members to share in Red Alpha's success as we continue to grow and expand our footprint; provide long\\-term career opportunities through stability and internal mobility; and provide the resources our members need to support themselves 
 *and* 
  their dependents in the form of a robust benefits package.  Our total compensation package includes a competitive base salary and benefits such as health, life/disability, 401k, paid time off, professional development, and generous bonus programs.  Please visit our benefits tab for additional information. 
 

  
 

*Salary Range:* 


* Disclosed pay ranges are a general guideline, and are not a guarantee of a final salary or compensation.  Our approach in determining final salaries takes into consideration a number of factors such as education, certifications, total years of relevant professional experience, actual level of expertise, and the responsibilities of the role itself.
* Based on the outlined roles, responsibilities, and requirements, the projected pay range for this position is: $80,000 \\- $150,000




*Some of our additional perks and benefits include:* 
                  
 

* *Retire sooner than planned:* 
  Get closer to retirement with up to 10% in 401k contributions, immediately vested.
* *Have a career AND a life:* 
  Enjoy up to 5 weeks of leave (25 days of personal time off) and 11 paid floating holidays.
* *Stay at your best:* 
  As a member, we'll pay 100% of your premiums for comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance. We'll also pay the majority of the premiums for your family.  Let's not forge free access to a fully equipped state of the art gym!
* *Keep current on new technologies and technological advancements* 
 :  $5250 per year towards ongoing education, trainings, certifications, and maintaining professional memberships.
* *Dress in style:* 
   Spend up to $300 per year on company branded merchandise featuring top quality brands such as Under Armour, Nike, Carhartt, YETI, etc.

**The Community – Baltimore, MD** 
  

 Baltimore is the second largest seaport in the Mid\\-Atlantic. Baltimore's Inner Harbor was once the second leading port of entry for immigrants to the United States and a major manufacturing center. After a decline in major manufacturing, industrialization and rail transportation, Baltimore shifted to a service\\-oriented economy, with the Johns Hopkins Hospital (founded 1889\\), and Johns Hopkins University (founded 1876\\), now the city's top two employers.
   

  

 With hundreds of identified districts, Baltimore has been dubbed ""a city of neighborhoods "". Famous residents have included the writers Edgar Allan Poe, Frederick Douglass and H.L. Mencken, jazz musician James ""Eubie "" Blake, singer Billie Holiday and baseball player Babe Ruth. In the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote The Star\\-Spangled Banner, later the American national anthem, in the city. Almost a quarter of the jobs in the Baltimore region are in science, technology, engineering and math, in part attributed to its extensive undergraduate and graduate schools.
