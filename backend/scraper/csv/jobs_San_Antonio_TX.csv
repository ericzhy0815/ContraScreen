 Grassroots Carbon is the leading grasslands restoration and soil carbon storage company based in San Antonio, TX.

By partnering with Grassroots Carbon, ranchers have access to additional revenue opportunities via our carbon credit program. More than 41 percent of U.S. grasslands are used for grazing, accounting for over 350 million acres, but less than 5 percent of that land is managed regeneratively.

We are on a mission to convert millions of acres of degraded grasslands into healthy, thriving ecosystems that sequester massive amounts of carbon. Grassroots Carbon has built a foundation of scientific rigor, quality, and trust to advance this mission and has secured long\\-term contracts with leading companies including Microsoft, Shell, Marathon Oil, HEB, Shopify, and Nestle to reach their carbon reduction and sustainability goals.
