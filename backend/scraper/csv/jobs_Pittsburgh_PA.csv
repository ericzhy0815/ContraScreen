**OVERVIEW:**


Everything we do at DICK’S Sporting Goods centers around our customers, or as we call them, our athletes. From online to in\\-store, we’re disrupting retail through technology.

  

Our Software Engineering teams are key disruptors. We empower our engineers to tear down the silos and work collaboratively with their product team to deliver solutions. We work in nimble product teams composed of engineers, designers, and product managers that aren’t bogged down by project plans and politics, but are empowered to continuously create, test and execute. One of the best parts is after the work is done, you get to see the results of your work in our stores, online and throughout our business. You get to make a difference.

 **First, let’s talk Tech**.


Here is a list of our platforms. Don’t worry, you don’t have to be a master at them all. Ideally, you’ll have experience in most of them.

* Angular 16\\+, CSS(SASS/SCSS), HTML 5, Webpack, Node.js
* Exposure to TypeScript, RxJS and other ES6 constructs
* Familiarity with React
* Experience with RESTful APIs
* Ideally has experience with NPM and Nrwl mono repositories
* Deployment of applications to cloud based service (Pivotal Cloud Foundry/AWS/Azure/Google Cloud)

 **As an Software Engineer II at DICK’s you will:**

* Bring at least 3\\-5 years of experience to the table
* Work collaboratively with designers, product managers, and engineers
* Leverage cutting\\-edge technologies and modern practices
* Build and ship high\\-quality code at a rapid pace
* Work with open source tools to build new technologies
* Have opportunities for career development as we continue to invest in our talent.
* Be a part of a collaborative, innovative culture tackling the challenges of scaling our business and serving up new experiences for our athletes.
* Work with great people in an engaging, remote environment while still having access to the many amenities the Pittsburgh campus has to offer, including a world\\-class health club, hoteling space, collaboration rooms, and enabled technology for hybrid meetings.

 **We believe that there is always a better way.**

**So, we will expect you to:**

* Continuously learn modern software design and development core practices, utilizing articles, MeetUps, conferences, tech talks, etc.
* Review and discuss code with engineering peers and leaders to understand best practices and optimal design patterns
* Increase your business acumen by consistently learning about other parts of the business
* Have a willingness to continuously learn, experiment, and innovate. Innovation is a critical part of our culture and an expectation for all teammates. If you like brainstorming with your peers on how to disrupt your product domain – or retail as a whole – you’ve come to the right place!

 **Lastly, here’s some stuff that won’t be part of your day\\-to\\-day.**

**At DICK’s you won’t:**

* Work in a silo
* Be limited by project plans
* Find yourself stuck in a boring cube
* Pay to park or be stuck in a corporate high\\-rise
* Be pigeonholed into proprietary and stagnant codebases

**QUALIFICATIONS:**

* Bachelor's Degree or equivalent level preferred
* General Experience: Experienced practitioner able to work unsupervised (13 months to 3 years)
* Managerial Experience: Basic experience of coordinating the work of others (4 to 6 months)
