Overview of School
  
  

Founded in 1921 by Elisabeth Irwin (a contemporary and colleague of John Dewey, Caroline Pratt, and Lucy Sprague Mitchell), The Little Red School House has been at the vanguard of pedagogical innovation since its founding. LREI's goal is to educate students to become independent thinkers and lifelong learners and to pursue academic excellence and individual achievement, in a context of respect for others and service to the community. We believe that learning should be active and experiential, with the school providing abundant opportunities for students to excel. We accept students with a range of abilities and talents who can take full advantage of a rich and demanding academic program in which each student is both challenged and supported. We seek to create within the school a community built on understanding and respecting others. Thus, our student body traditionally reflects the racial and cultural diversity of our city, and our curriculum is built on interdisciplinary studies to promote understanding of many cultures. While individual achievement is encouraged and rewarded, our program underscores the value of shared goals, friendship, and cooperation in mastering difficult tasks. The progressive ideals that in 1921 gave life and inspiration to the school — academic excellence and creativity, active learning and innovative teaching, respect for the individual and responsibility to the community \\- continue to guide the school today. LREI is located in vibrant Greenwich Village and classes venture forth often to use the neighborhood and the city to provide rich learning experiences.

We're building Bitkey, a simple and safe self\\-custody bitcoin wallet that will put customers in control, as well as hardware and software that will help decentralize bitcoin mining and enable new and innovative use cases for bitcoin mining. We're developing these products in the open \\- you can read more about them at bitkey.build and mining.build. Within Proto, our Bitcoin Products team delivers the product and go\\-to\\-market strategy, software, firmware, and custom silicon needed to make Bitkey and our ambitious mining initiatives a reality. Come build the future of money with us!


**The Role**



Proto's vision is to contribute to the health of the bitcoin network by decentralizing both the supply of mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate. To realize this, we'll introduce competitive mining chips, rigs, and software products that offer new alternatives to mining operators of all sizes and which expand the scope of mining to include innovative applications (e.g. heat reuse, off\\-grid mining, home mining) beyond the current industrially\\-dominated market.



And we are well\\-positioned to deliver on this vision. Existing miners are not satisfied with our competitors — they're exhausted with unreliable hardware, difficulty securing supply, unfavorable payment terms, and nearly nonexistent support. All of these weaknesses are amongst our strengths: we've shipped tens of millions of reliable devices, are excellent operationally, can support a consistent supply of chips and rigs, and have strong customer support capability built up through multiple successful business lines. Additionally, we bring a clear customer focus and go\\-to\\-market capability that doesn't yet exist in mining — and mining operators recognize Block as a leader in the bitcoin space and are anxious to add an additional supplier, especially one based in the US.



We are seeking a skilled backend engineer for Proto's software suite. These two products aim to bring the best user experience in the world for miners to control their operation and connect with external services such as pools and miner management systems. Our approach is to give customers a significantly greater degree of control and diagnostic capability than what currently exists in the market. This role will be essential in making this experience a reality, not only focusing on how a miner may use our software to run their fleet, but ensuring we do it in a safe and secure manner.


**You Will**


* Design and implement APIs for bitcoin miner connectivity.
* Develop APIs to support real\\-time KPI monitoring, bulk deployment of settings, and parameter updates.
* Integrate miner fleet management systems with third\\-party tools for monitoring.
* Ensure secure and stable local connectivity for bitcoin mining hardware.
* Collaborate with hardware teams to validate mining system performance.
* Work closely with engineering and product teams to meet milestones, including upcoming demos and pilots, and our eventual launch later in the year.


**You Have**

  


* A minimum of 8 years professional experience building software
* Experience developing backend applications that communicate across the network.
* Experience with API design and implementation, particularly in real\\-time systems.
* Experience building relational databases for transactional and analytical workloads
* Expertise developing highly concurrent or asynchronous web application using NodeJS and Typescript or similar languages such as Go, Kotlin, Rust or Ruby
* Strong problem\\-solving skills and attention to detail.
* Ability to work in a fast\\-paced, milestone\\-driven environment.


**Bonus:**


* Familiarity with bitcoin mining hardware and protocols.
* Experience working with Electron or Tauri application frameworks.
* Experience implementing secure web authorization and authentication schemes.

Do you want to join a brand\\-new team building an AI system that would disrupt the industry? Do you enjoy dealing with ambiguity and working on hard problems in a fast\\-paced environment?
  
  

Amazon Connect is a highly disruptive cloud\\-based contact center that enables businesses to deliver engaging, dynamic, and personal customer service experiences. With Amazon Connect, you can create your own cloud\\-based contact center and be taking calls in minutes. Amazon Connect leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence and the large ecosystem of AWS services such as Lex, Polly, Lambda, S3, and Kinesis to provide a truly frustration free and natural customer experience. With this technology, we are transforming an industry and the way customers interact with businesses and how agents service them.
  
  

As a Data Scientist on our team, you will analyze data from massive data sets to categorize customer idiosyncrasies, identify outliers, and systematically detect anomalies that substantially affect the performance of our models. You will work closely with other senior technical leaders within the team and across AWS. You should know how to trace decisions in data from raw data through complex models to their impact business metrics. Experience with machine learning explainability is a plus. You should be able to translate well\\-defined business problems into data science problems and you solve these problems using appropriate assumptions, methodologies, and data science best practices. Our team is at an early stage, so you will have significant impact on our deliverables with no operational load from existing models/systems.
  
  

We have a rapidly growing customer base and an exciting charter in front of us that includes solving highly complex engineering and algorithmic problems. We are looking for passionate, talented, and experienced people to join us to innovate on this new service that addresses customer needs to build modern contact centers in the cloud. The position represents a rare opportunity to be a part of a fast\\-growing business soon after launch, and help shape the technology and product as we grow. You will be playing a crucial role in developing the next generation contact center, and get the opportunity to design and deliver scalable, resilient systems while maintaining a constant customer focus.

Key job responsibilities
  
**Categorizing Customer Idiosyncrasies:** As we expand to more customers, we are discovering that they use our product in very different ways and that poses issues for our models. Effectively summarizing these differences (for example, X% of customers do Y) would be immensely helpful.
  
  

**Detecting and Cleaning Up Outliers:** We have situations where outliers have a huge impact on model outputs. You will help us develop mechanisms to clean up outliers for downstream consumption.
  
  

**Deep Diving Customer Issues:** Customers have longstanding traditions and trusted formulas for managing their contact centers. When our formulas differ from theirs, we need to deep dive these discrepancies and determine if there is an issue with our model or if we are giving the customer better results than they are used to.
  
  

**Assessing Data Gaps:** It's hard to estimate the weather in Seattle if the only data you have is the average weight of elephants in Zimbabwe. We know we don't have all the data we need, but we need to answer two related questions: (a) what features can we derive in creative ways from existing data sources? (b) can we estimate the benefit of getting a new data stream in terms of accuracy improvement?
  
  

A day in the life
  
Our team uses agile project management, so the DS calls in to our daily stand\\-up meeting in the morning to report status and explain their tasks for the day. Throughout the day, the DS will work with our product manager to discuss outstanding issues with our customers that require deep dives, work with our scientists to discuss model performance issues, and discuss software deliverables with our SDEs such as automation of data ingestion to save DS time, deployment of models, etc.
  
  

About the team
  
Our team is called Eliza and it was founded in 2019 to expedite science adoption in Connect. We are a team of scientists and engineers working on multiple science projects for Amazon Connect. Our team members work closely together to explore different approaches that can simplify management of contact centers and delight our customers and we move fast to implement solutions and refine them based on customer feedback.

* Etsy’s intern program offers Mentorship, Technical Talk series, Internal panels, Executive Fireside Chats, social events and more!
* Of course, this is just a sample of the kinds of work this role will require! You should assume that your role will encompass other tasks, too, and that your job duties and responsibilities may change from time to time at Etsy's discretion, or otherwise applicable with local law.

 We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
   

  

 We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
   

  

 Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays \\& Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
   

  

**About The Role**
 Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means millions of people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion. This is where you come in — to help us forge a simple and powerful set of tools to guide us to the future.
   

  

 Everyday, people use Notion to power their workflows from project updates, bug tracking, creative requests, habit tracking and more. The Automations team’s mission is to empower individuals and organizations to automate a broad set of workflows, enhancing productivity by minimizing routine work. As an Automations engineer, you’ll get to directly shape some of Notion’s key building blocks.
   

  

 You’ll play a leading role in developing the technical and product foundations of Automations to ensure we can provide a powerful, connected, and reliable set of tools. Your role as a product engineer will involve understanding user needs, collaborating with product, design, and other engineering teams to design and develop elegant solutions to ambiguous problems. Finally, you’ll do all the above in a fast\\-paced, highly collaborative and dynamic work environment!
   

  

**What You'll Achieve**
* You’ll build and maintain foundational pieces of Notion’s building blocks, enabling a wide array of use cases in Notion such as project management, goal tracking and more.
* You'll work with the team to build new product features with the right infrastructure. For example, you might build a new type of Automation trigger or improve the performance of Formulas.
* You’ll contribute to the overall performance, reliability, and robustness of the Notion product, ensuring it scales elegantly across many dimensions.
* You’ll engage with all layers of the stack, spanning client and server environments, utilizing technologies like React, NodeJS, Postgres, Kafka, AWS, etc.
* You’ll work with a team of engineers and cross\\-functional partners across product, design, data science, and user research to define solutions and drive execution through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance.


**What We're Looking For**
* Proven track record of execution: You have 7\\+ years of engineering experience, including several years building world\\-class product experiences alongside a team of engineers.
* Thoughtful Problem\\-solving: You seek to understand complex problems deeply in order to develop multiple solutions, from which you can articulate tradeoffs between user impact, timeline, scope, craft, and tech debt.
* Impact Driven: You care about user impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not motivated to use new technologies on their own, but through careful analysis of their applicability to the problem at hand, taking into account long term implications of technical decisions.
* Clear and Empathetic Communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and work together to find agreeable outcomes.
* Tech leadership experience: You have previously held positions where you were responsible for making key technical decisions, guiding a team through complex projects, and mentoring junior team members.
* Ability to Scale: You have experience scaling distributed systems to support rapid growth, or you're motivated and excited to learn.


**Nice To Haves**
* You’re a tool builder at heart and are excited by the prospect of assembling Notion’s primitives to solve use\\-case oriented problems.
* You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, Postgres, Docker, Kafka and Redis.
* You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.


 We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik, Ashby's Co\\-Founder and VP of Engineering. Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software. I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer, not just because the work was fun but because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand\\-ups, no t\\-shirt sizing, no planning meetings. It was an exhilarating experience to have straight out of college. I studied computer science to solve problems using software in a way that wasn’t possible before – not be a JIRA jockey. My first job allowed me to do just that, and I felt creative and fulfilled. When I moved to technology startups, I saw my role narrow (significantly as the company grew), and the enjoyment of building software went with it. It was disheartening because, in Visual Effects, I witnessed some of the most innovative ideas from experienced engineers who blended their technical skills with customer empathy and business context. Such ideas came from the engineers' in\\-depth knowledge of how software is built, allowing them to create new abstractions or implement technology in novel ways. It’s a level of creativity that is difficult for most product managers or designers to achieve. I still saw these ideas in technology startups, but as the team grew, these ideas often came to fruition through force of will and the engineer’s ability to push back against the company’s culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering became narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of ""Agile"" processes like sprint planning. I don’t want that to happen at Ashby. We’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces the innovative engineers, and frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end\\-to\\-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have: Designed and built automated candidate scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. Built a generalized filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user\\-facing features use it. Spec\\-ed, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features. What We’re Building Talent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up! Scheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last\\-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 Ashby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here (and are what we often replace!). We have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I’ll share more once we meet. Why You Should or Shouldn’t Apply Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for: You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team). You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and the intersection of the two is where you thrive. We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and much of the challenges we tackle require using your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems. You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn’t built quickly, we took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high\\-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency – we’ve built the equivalent of 3\\+ VC\\-backed startups with a very small team. You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it). You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here! You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time\\-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. Put another way, you shouldn’t apply if: You need company\\-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well\\-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges. You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high\\-leveled ICs. You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront. You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them. You want to mentor earlier career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects. Consequently, we need engineers with that experience, which requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 75% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited. A tech lead, staff, or principal engineer, to you, is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign\\-off. Engineering Culture Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my co\\-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high\\-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). Collaboration is Natural \\& Communication is Deliberate Our engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them here!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in \\<2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here). Increase Leverage, not Team Size We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in: Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes \\~10m, and we deploy at least 10x a day. Everyone on the team has contributed to developer experience 💪🏾 Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below). Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby: And a demo of one of these building blocks: Give Engineers Ownership \\& Agency We, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. Benji and I did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end\\-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end\\-to\\-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don’t get to practice as engineers, and, at Ashby, we provide mentorship to grow them and help from the team where you want it. Put Effort into Diversity Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non\\-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups. Today, 26% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more. Interview Process At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions (no leetcode or whiteboard exercises). Our interview process is three rounds: 30\\-minute introduction call A technical screen (take home or 75\\-minute in\\-person) A virtual on\\-site of 4 hours and 15 minutes (can be split across two days) Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback! Your First Two Months at Ashby We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment sets up with a single script, you push your first change on day one, and we spend the rest of the time building your confidence in our codebase and practices culminating in the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. We’ll pair you with a peer who’ll guide you through your first tasks and be someone you rely on, from answering questions to pair programming. Technology Stack I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend \\& backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis. Benefits Competitive salary and equity. 10\\-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable. Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one\\-on\\-one agenda until you start taking it 😅. Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise. Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive! $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval. If you’re in the US, top\\-notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us. Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply. Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities. Compensation Range: $160K \\- $260K","","","","","","","",""

We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti\\-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.
   

  

 Our Agency's five strategic priorities, building off a recently completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID\\-19 emergency, are:

In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti\\-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.

 Amazon Connect leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence and the large ecosystem of AWS services such as Lex, Polly, Lambda, S3, and Kinesis to provide a truly frustration free and natural customer experience. With this technology, we are transforming an industry and the way customers interact with businesses and how agents service them.
   

  

 As a Data Scientist on our team, you will analyze data from massive data sets to categorize customer idiosyncrasies, identify outliers, and systematically detect anomalies that substantially affect the performance of our models.
 



 You will work closely with other senior technical leaders within the team and across AWS. You should know how to trace decisions in data from raw data through complex models to their impact business metrics. Experience with machine learning explainability is a plus.
 



 You should be able to translate well\\-defined business problems into data science problems and you solve these problems using appropriate assumptions, methodologies, and data science best practices.

 Key job responsibilities
   

 Categorizing Customer Idiosyncrasies: As we expand to more customers, we are discovering that they use our product in very different ways and that poses issues for our models
 



 Effectively summarizing these differences (for example, X% of customers do Y) would be immensely helpful.
   

  

 Detecting and Cleaning Up Outliers: We have situations where outliers have a huge impact on model outputs. You will help us develop mechanisms to clean up outliers for downstream consumption.
   

  

 Deep Diving Customer Issues: Customers have longstanding traditions and trusted formulas for managing their contact centers. When our formulas differ from theirs, we need to deep dive these discrepancies and determine if there is an issue with our model or if we are giving the customer better results than they are used to.
   

  

 Assessing Data Gaps: It's hard to estimate the weather in Seattle if the only data you have is the average weight of elephants in Zimbabwe
 



 We know we don't have all the data we need, but we need to answer two related questions: (a) what features can we derive in creative ways from existing data sources. (b) can we estimate the benefit of getting a new data stream in terms of accuracy improvement?
   

  

 A day in the life
   

 Our team uses agile project management, so the DS calls in to our daily stand\\-up meeting in the morning to report status and explain their tasks for the day. Throughout the day, the DS will work with our product manager to discuss outstanding issues with our customers that require deep dives, work with our scientists to discuss model performance issues, and discuss software deliverables with our SDEs such as automation of data ingestion to save DS time, deployment of models, etc.
   

  

 About the team
   

 Our team is called Eliza and it was founded in 2019 to expedite science adoption in Connect
 



 We are a team of scientists and engineers working on multiple science projects for Amazon Connect. Our team members work closely together to explore different approaches that can simplify management of contact centers and delight our customers and we move fast to implement solutions and refine them based on customer feedback.
