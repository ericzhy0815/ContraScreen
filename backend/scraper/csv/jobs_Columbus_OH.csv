**JOB DESCRIPTION**




 A client of Insight Global is seeking a passionate, MLOPs Automation Engineer. We are seeking a highly
 
 technical
 
 engineer for the role of Technical Product Owner \\-\\- Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) in a 90\\-day contract\\-to\\-hire capacity.
 



 This is
 
 not a traditional business\\-focused
 
 product owner role \\-\\- we need someone with deep
 
 technical experience
 
 in MLOps, cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and CI/CD pipelines. While formal product management experience is a plus, we prefer engineers with strong technical foundations who are eager to step into a product leadership role. If you are a product owner with very deep relevant (see more below) technical expertise, we are open to having a conversation. In either case, you need to be able to articulate your deep experience in the form of responses to screening questions. I expect detailed responses instead of 1\\-2 lines for each question.
 



 This role is ideal for:
 


* Experienced MLOps engineers, DevOps engineers, or ML engineers looking to transition into technical product management.
* Current product owners with strong MLOps and DevOps expertise.
* The first 30 days include structured onboarding and refresher training to align with our internal frameworks, DevOps/MLOps best practices, and enterprise expectations. This is not entry\\-level training, but a targeted upskilling for engineers transitioning into product management. There will be an assessment test after 30\\-days to ensure the right fit.



**Key Responsibilities** 




 1\\. Transition \\& Structured Onboarding (First 30 Days).
 



 Participate in structured onboarding to align with:
 


* The compnay's internal product owner methodologies and governance.
* Enterprise\\-specific MLOps workflows, DevOps pipelines, and platform architecture.
* Infrastructure\\-as\\-code best practices (Terraform, Kubernetes, AWS cloud\\-native deployments).



 Complete targeted refresher training on:
 


* MLOps frameworks
* CI/CD pipelines, Terraform, and DevOps automation.
* AWS SageMaker workflows, feature stores, and model monitoring.



 Begin owning backlog, conduct discovery sessions and start owning the requirement gathering responsibilities from Week 1 while completing technical refreshers.
 



 2\\. Product Ownership \\& Backlog Management
 


* Work closely with data scientists, engineers, and business users to define requirements for machine learning models and analytics pipelines.
* Own and refine the backlog in Azure DevOps (ADO) ensuring clarity, prioritization, and traceability.
* Conduct deep discovery conversations to define ROI, project scope, and ‘Definition of Done’ for machine learning and analytics solutions.
* Translate engineering needs into structured product requirements while considering scalability, automation, and operational efficiency.
* Translate business needs into very detailed structured requirements for Solution Engineers.
* Ensure model deployment requirements (batch, real\\-time, LLMs) are well\\-defined and integrated into downstream systems.



 3\\. Solution Engineering \\& Implementation Collaboration
 


* Bridge the gap between engineering and business, translating technical challenges into actionable backlog items.



 Collaborate with:
 


* Solution Engineering Team, Cyber teams and architects for architectural design.
* Implementation Engineering Team for solution deployment.
* Production Support Team to define monitoring, alerting, and incident management.
* Machine Learning Engineering Team to drive platform enhancements.
* Ensure model outputs are correctly routed (Data Lake, Kafka Event Hub, BigQuery, Apigee Gateway).



 4\\. Governance, Monitoring \\& Incident Management
 


* Define and document model drift and data drift detection requirements along with Model Risk Management (MRM) requirements.
* Ensure the solution meets and exceeds MRM expectations related to Model’s metadata (KPIs) and governance.
* Ensure robust incident tracking workflows via ServiceNow, eliminating reliance on email\\-based alerts.
* Work with engineers to enforce CI/CD best practices for automated model deployment and monitoring.



  





**Why Join Us?** 



* Opportunity to be hands on in MLOps maturity journey. Deep exposure to cloud\\-native AI/ML infrastructure and open\\-source MLOps tools.
* Unique opportunity for engineers to transition into product management in a structured and high\\-impact environment.
* Immediate contributions to enterprise\\-scale MLOps initiatives.
* 90\\-day contract\\-to\\-hire with a clear path to full\\-time conversion.
* Work on cutting\\-edge AI/ML deployments across marketing, risk, and financial optimization.","Banking","https://www.linkedin.com/company/insight-global","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQGUNIyRZFaj0g/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1657049194702/insight_global_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=DgPf2KH2qEgV2aPJ2mFY1olLW0chPXs0DYd3jAp5tQ0","","","","",""

**Product Ownership \\& Backlog Management** 



* Collaborate with data scientists, engineers, and business users to define machine learning and analytics requirements.
* Own and prioritize backlog in Azure DevOps (ADO) ensuring clarity and traceability.
* Lead discovery sessions to define ROI, scope, and ‘Definition of Done’ for solutions.
* Translate business needs into structured requirements for Solution Engineers and ensure model deployment integration (batch, real\\-time, LLMs).



**Solution Engineering \\& Implementation** 



* Act as a bridge between engineering and business, translating technical challenges into actionable items.
* Collaborate with Solution Engineering, Cyber teams, architects, and Implementation Engineers for design and deployment.
* Work with Production Support to define monitoring, alerting, and incident management.
* Ensure proper routing of model outputs (Data Lake, Kafka, BigQuery, Apigee Gateway).



**Governance, Monitoring \\& Incident Management** 



* Define model drift, data drift detection, and Model Risk Management (MRM) requirements.
* Ensure solutions meet MRM standards related to model metadata (KPIs) and governance.
* Establish incident tracking workflows via ServiceNow, removing reliance on email alerts.
* Enforce CI/CD best practices for automated model deployment and monitoring.



**Qualifications \\& Required Experience** 




 ·        7\\+ years of hands\\-on experience in MLOps, ML Engineering, DevOps, or Data Engineering.
 



 ·        Experience in an ML setting is mandatory. Pure DevOps or Data Engineering without ML context is not what we are looking for.
 



 Either:
 



 ·        Previous product ownership experience in an MLOps or DevOps\\-focused team.
 



 ·        OR An experienced MLOps engineer looking to transition into product management.
 



  





 Deep technical expertise in the following.
 


* Be able to write code (primarily Python, Terraform) when necessary.
* CI/CD pipelines, DevOps automation, and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) best practices.
* Cloud\\-native ML infrastructure (AWS, S3, Lambda, EKS, EventBridge, SNS, SQS, Kafka, Event Hub, BigQuery, Apigee).
* Infrastructure\\-as\\-code (Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker).
* Should have worked on any of the open source MLOps frameworks (Shakudo, MLflow, DVC, Great Expectations, Airflow, KServe, Kubeflow).
* Amazon SageMaker (Pipelines, Feature Store, Model Registry, Model Monitor, Endpoints).
